            The Little Girl Who Was Afraid of Bad Dreams
          </h2>
          <p>
            Once there was a little girl who was very afraid of bad dreams.
            Sometimes she didn’t even want to fall asleep because she was afraid that nightmares would come.
            And when she did fall asleep and had a bad dream, she would wake up screaming and cry from fear.
            One night, the little girl refused to sleep at all, just so she wouldn’t see bad dreams.
            “Sweetheart, it’s time for bed,” her mother said gently. “You don’t only have bad dreams. What if tonight you dream something kind and beautiful?”
            “No, Mommy, I’m scared. I won’t sleep,” said the girl.
            “Then think about something nice and pleasant,” her mother suggested.
            “I try, but bad dreams still come,” the girl sighed.
            “But they can’t hurt you,” her mother reminded her. “They’re only in your imagination!”
            “Yes, but I’m still afraid…”
            “Then next time you have a nightmare, open your eyes and say out loud: ‘Where the night goes, the dream goes too.’
            Then imagine your dream turning into a little ball in your hands, and throw it far, far away.”
            The girl listened to her mother’s advice and closed her eyes. She didn’t notice how she fell into another scary dream.
            She woke up with a scream and began to cry — but then she remembered her mother’s words.
            She said three times: “Where the night goes, the dream goes too.”
            Then she “gathered” her bad dream into her fist and threw it far away, like a little ball.
            To her surprise, the fear quickly disappeared, and she happily fell asleep again.
            This time, her dream was sweet and joyful.
            From that day on, the little girl was no longer afraid of bad dreams, because she knew how to chase them away.
            She also understood that bad dreams could not harm her or her parents in any way.

            The Bunny Who Was Afraid of the Darkness
          </h2>
          <p>
            In a dark, dark forest, there lived a bunny who was very afraid of the dark.
            Even during the day the forest was gloomy, and when night came, the bunny became so scared that he hid in the bushes and squeezed his eyes shut.
            He always thought danger was hiding in the darkness...
            He imagined that when night fell, ghosts would wake up to scare him.
            Sometimes he thought someone might suddenly say a scary “Boo!” or laugh in a creepy way.
            Of course, none of this was real. It all lived only in our hero’s imagination. But the bunny didn’t know that.
            And he didn’t know how to beat his fear, even though he had to live in the dark most of the time.
            One day, the bush where the bunny was hiding got tired of watching him shiver at night and decided to help:
            “Why are you afraid of the dark?”
            “Because ghosts and other scary things appear in it,” answered the bunny.
            “No, ghosts and scary things are born only in your imagination. In the dark, there is nothing like that,” said the bush.
            “But then where do the strange night sounds in the forest come from? Like someone walking on leaves and quietly howling?”
            “The wind rustles the leaves, and the wolves howl at the far end of the forest. But that doesn’t mean you should be afraid. You’re safe. That fear is only in your head. In reality, the dark is not scary. Don’t believe me?”
            The bunny shook his head.
            “Then close your eyes and imagine you’re on a deserted island,” the bush said, shaking its leaves loudly.
            The bunny jumped in fright and cried out.
            “What scared you just now?” asked the bush.
            “I thought a big predator was hunting me, sneaking through the leaves,” the bunny admitted shyly.
            “All right. Now imagine you’re lying in the sun, and the gentle sea is beside you,” said the bush, shaking its leaves again. “Are you scared now?”
            “Not at all,” the bunny said in surprise. “I thought I was lying in the sun, listening to the waves.”
            “See? In both cases, it was only your imagination. I made the same sound twice. There was no real island or beach. Once you were afraid, and once you weren’t. The dark is the same. There’s nothing scary in it — only in the pictures your mind makes.”
            From that day on, the bunny stopped being afraid of the dark.
            When night came, he no longer imagined ghosts or frightening things.
            Instead, he lay down next to the bush, wrapped himself in a blanket, and fell asleep sweetly to the sound of the forest wind.
            Now that sound didn’t seem scary at all! And if a scary picture popped into his mind, he simply replaced it with something pleasant.

            The Girl Who Was Afraid to Stay Home Alone
          </h2>
          <p>
            Once upon a time, there was a lovely girl named Alice, who was in the second grade.
            One day, her parents went to the store to buy groceries, but they didn’t take Alice with them.
            The moment her mom and dad stepped outside and locked the door, Alice felt so scared that she began to cry.
            She thought her parents might never come back.
            She was also afraid that while they were gone, a stranger might come into their home and take her away.
            Her imagination ran so wild that she jumped at every little sound by the front door.
            She imagined that any second, a strange hand would put a key into the lock, and someone she didn’t know would walk in…
            Suddenly, she heard a kind voice.
            “Hello! Don’t be afraid. It’s me — your home, your protection.”
            Alice was very surprised but still asked,
            “Am I going crazy? My home is talking to me!”
            “Not at all,” the voice replied. “You can call me Mr. Home. I really can talk to you, and you’re not dreaming. I can see you’re very scared, so I decided to help you feel calm while you wait for your parents.”
            “Really?” Alice asked in surprise. “How can I stop feeling this fear? I’m so afraid to be home alone!”
            “I understand,” said Mr. Home. “But look around and think — what exactly are you afraid of? See? There’s no one here except you and your things. Your parents locked the door with all the locks, and no one but them can open it. Only you and your parents have the keys to your home. And most importantly — I’m here with you. I protect you whenever you’re inside. Trust me, I’m your real protection, and your parents will be back very soon — you’ll see.”
            Alice looked around and thought about it.
            It was true — nothing bad could happen just because she stayed home for an hour.
            “Mr. Home, you’re right. I really was scared, but you’ve calmed me down. Thank you. I guess I was just letting my imagination scare me too much,” the girl said.
            “Exactly! Now you understand. So tell me — if you don’t think about bad things right now, are you still afraid?”
            “No.”
            “Good girl! See how much depends on your thoughts? Now, focus on something fun. What would you like to do?”
            “I think I’ll play a board game.”
            “Then go ahead! While you’re focused on the game, no fear can get into your mind.”
            Alice took out her favorite game and started playing with interest.
            Before she knew it, her mom and dad were back.
            She ran to hug them tightly. How wonderful it was to have them home again!
            From that day on, Alice stopped being afraid to stay home alone.
            She remembered Mr. Home’s words, didn’t imagine scary things, and always found something exciting to do while waiting for her parents.

            The Kitten on the Lonely Island
          </h2>
          <p>
            Once upon a time, there was a little kitten who one day found himself on an uninhabited island.
            At first, he was very frightened — there wasn’t a single soul around.
            “Am I really all alone here?” he thought, and the little one began to cry.
            When the kitten calmed down a bit, he decided to walk around the island and explore it.
            To his surprise, he saw things he had never noticed before — the beauty of the world around him.
            “Wow!” he thought, holding his breath, as he watched the sunlight sparkle on the surface of the sea.
            When he was sure there was no one else on the island, the kitten suddenly realized how wonderful it could be to have peace and quiet, just for himself.
            He enjoyed the stillness, then fell asleep — no one disturbed him, no one woke him up.
            He woke only when he had slept enough.
            “Oh, what a good, sweet sleep I had!” he said, stretching with a yawn.
            Then the kitten lay in the warm sun and played with twigs and sand.
            “So many fun games you can invent, even alone,” he thought, happy with what he had right then and there.
            When the kitten felt ready to go back to his friends, he spoke to the island:
            “Thank you, island, for your hospitality, but it’s time for me to go home.”
            The little kitten closed his eyes — and when he opened them, he was back home, surrounded by his friends.
            From that day on, the kitten was no longer afraid of being alone.
            He now knew that being by yourself could also be fun and interesting.
            And he understood that every living creature sometimes needs silence, peace, and a break from everyone.
