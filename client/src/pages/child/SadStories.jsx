            <h2 className="font-bold text-center mb-4">Tony and the Empty Nest</h2>
            <p>
              Once there was a little bird named Tony, who lived high in a tall tree.
              One sunny morning, he flew off to explore the meadow.
              When he returned, his nest was empty — his parents were gone.
              Tony’s tiny heart began to beat fast.
              “Where are they? What if they never come back?” he thought.
              He sat in his nest, feeling his chest get heavy and his eyes fill with tears.
              His wings drooped, and he whispered, “I’m all alone.”
              After a while, he noticed the wind softly moving the branches.
              It felt as though the forest was whispering to him.
              Tony closed his eyes and took three deep breaths — in, out, in, out — just like his mother had once taught him when he was scared.
              With every breath, his body felt a little less tense.
              He looked around and saw a butterfly passing by.
              It stopped for a moment, as if to say hello, then continued its gentle dance in the air.
              He followed it with his eyes, and soon he felt less alone — he remembered that the forest was full of life.
              After some time, he heard familiar wingbeats.
              His parents appeared, each carrying a berry.
              They hugged him with their wings.
              “We just went to find food for you,” they said kindly.
              “I was so sad and afraid,” Tony admitted. “I thought you might not come back.”
              His father smiled. “It’s okay to feel that way, little one. But remember — just because someone is away, doesn’t mean they’re gone forever. We always return.”
              From that day on, whenever Tony felt lonely, he would take deep breaths, look around, and notice who or what was still there with him.
              He learned that sadness can pass when you remember you are still surrounded by life and love.

            <h2 className="font-bold text-center mb-4">Anna and the Rainy Day</h2>
            <p>
              The turtle Anna woke up one morning with exciting plans — she was going to play in the sunny meadow.
              But when she peeked outside her shell, she saw nothing but grey clouds and heavy rain.
              She sighed deeply. “Now my day is ruined.”
              She felt something heavy in her chest — it was disappointment turning into sadness.
              She pulled her head back into her shell and didn’t want to come out.
              After a while, she heard a soft tapping sound.
              Curious, she peeked out and saw raindrops falling into the pond, making little circles.
              Anna stared at them. “Hmm… they look like tiny dances on the water.”
              She slowly walked to the pond and sat by the edge.
              She started counting the circles: “One… two… three…”
              The more she counted, the calmer she felt.
              A frog hopped over and said, “Why do you look so serious?”
              “I’m sad because I can’t play in the meadow,” Anna replied.
              The frog smiled. “When it rains, I get to splash in puddles! Want to try?”
              Anna hesitated, then dipped one foot into the water.
              Splash! It made a bigger circle than before.
              She began to splash with both feet, laughing with the frog.
              By the time the rain stopped, Anna had forgotten her sadness.
              She realized that even when plans change, you can find new ways to have fun.
              Now, whenever she felt disappointed, she remembered the splashing circles and asked herself, “What can I do with what I have right now?”

            <h2 className="font-bold text-center mb-4">The Kitten and the Broken Toy</h2>
            <p>
              The kitten Leo had a favorite toy — a bright red ball.
              Every day, he chased it around the yard, leaping and pouncing with joy.
              One afternoon, he rolled it too hard, and it slipped under the fence.
              He tried to reach it with his paw, but it was gone.
              His ears drooped. “It’s not fair,” Leo whispered.
              He sat on the grass, feeling his throat tighten and his eyes get wet.
              He wanted to cry — not just because of the ball, but because it had been his special game.
              After a while, he noticed a butterfly with blue wings land nearby.
              It flapped gently, as if inviting him to follow.
              Leo hesitated. “But I’m sad…” he thought. Then he remembered what his mom once told him: “When you feel sad, notice what’s around you. Something new might be waiting.”
              He slowly got up and padded after the butterfly.
              They played a little game — the butterfly would fly a short distance, and Leo would chase it.
              He laughed when it landed right on his nose.
              By sunset, Leo felt light again.
              He realized that sadness can fade when you let yourself enjoy new moments.
              And though he still missed his ball, he now knew that fun could come from unexpected places.

            <h2 className="font-bold text-center mb-4">The Bunny Who Missed Her Friend</h2>
            <p>
              Kiki the bunny and Sasha the squirrel were best friends.
              They played together every day — running, hiding, and sharing snacks.
              One morning, Sasha told her, “I’m going away for a whole week to visit my cousins.”
              Kiki smiled, but inside, she felt a lump in her throat.
              After Sasha left, the forest felt too quiet.
              Even the flowers seemed less bright.
              She sat under their favorite tree, feeling the sadness settle in her chest.
              Then she remembered something their teacher had told them: “When you miss someone, you can keep them close in your heart by thinking of happy times together.”
              Kiki went inside and got her crayons.
              She began to draw all their favorite games — the meadow races, the nut treasure hunts, the afternoons by the stream.
              The more she drew, the warmer she felt inside.
              When Sasha came back, Kiki gave her the drawings.
              Sasha laughed and said, “Now I know exactly what we’ll play next!”
              Kiki realized that missing someone means you love them — and that love can make the wait easier.

            <h2 className="font-bold text-center mb-4">Bella the Little Fish and the Empty Sea Garden</h2>
            <p>
              Bella the fish loved visiting the coral garden every evening.
              It was her favorite place — full of bright colors and tiny sea creatures.
              One day, she swam there and found the corals closed up for the night.
              The garden looked dark and quiet.
              Bella felt her fins droop. “It’s not the same,” she thought.
              She floated near a rock, feeling a small ache in her heart.
              Then she saw a trail of bubbles rising to the surface.
              She followed them and began to blow her own bubbles.
              They floated and popped, and she started to giggle.
              A small crab came over. “Why are you laughing?”
              “Because I thought I couldn’t have fun without the corals,” Bella said. “But I can.”
              When the corals opened again the next day, she enjoyed them even more.
              She had learned that even when something beautiful is missing, there is always another way to find joy — if you look for it.

            <h2 className="font-bold text-center mb-4">The Little Red Balloon Who Learned Not to Hold Grudges</h2>
            <p>
              Once upon a time, there was a little balloon. He was bright red with a sky-blue string. He floated happily in the sky, sometimes without even noticing that the wind had carried him to small towns where children lived. Everyone loved the cheerful balloon — whenever kids spotted him in the blue sky, they waved and shouted, “Hello, balloon!” And he, full of joy, floated on.
              But sometimes, it happened that someone was not happy to see him. One day, drifting over a small town, the balloon spotted a little boy below. The boy pointed at him — but not with joy.
              “Yuck! What an ugly balloon!” the boy called out.
              “Ugly? Why am I ugly?” the balloon wondered.
              “You’re red and small. I have a huge balloon at home, and it’s beautiful — not like you.”
              The balloon felt hurt. The boy’s words stung so much that suddenly he began to swell up. Bigger and bigger he grew, drifting lower. He couldn’t understand why this was happening.
              As he floated on, the boy’s words echoed in his mind: “Ugly and small…” Soon, he spotted a little stream below. He drifted down to see his reflection.
              “Is red really an ugly color? Why would he say that? Everyone used to like me…” A tiny tear fell into the water.
              He noticed in the reflection that he was swelling again, as though someone were blowing more air into him. “What’s going on? Why do I keep getting bigger?” he thought. A gust of wind swept him away, but being so overinflated made it hard to float.
              He decided to rest. Landing near a small wooden cabin with painted shutters, he peeked through the windows — no one was inside. Suddenly, he heard footsteps behind him.
              It was a young rabbit with long ears.
              “Bunny, is this your house?” asked the balloon.
              “Oh! You startled me,” the rabbit said. “No, this is the forester’s cabin. I came to visit him.”
              “He’s not home,” the balloon replied. “I looked through the windows.”
              “Then let’s wait for him together.”
              “All right. But… can I ask you something?”
              “Sure,” said the rabbit.
              “Do you like the color red?” the balloon asked nervously.
              “No, not really,” the rabbit said honestly. “I prefer green or orange.”
              “What?! So you don’t like me?” snapped the balloon. “Then I won’t wait with you! I don’t like rabbits either!” He puffed up so much that the rabbit stepped back in fear.
              The balloon swelled more and more, certain he would soon pop. Just then, the forester appeared with a basket of mushrooms.
              “What’s going on here?” he asked.
              The rabbit explained quickly. The balloon tried to speak, but it was hard while so puffed up.
              “I… I… don’t want to pop,” he managed.
              “Calm down,” the forester said gently. “Tell me what happened, and I’ll help you.”
              The balloon let out a little air and told his story — how the boy had insulted him, and then how the rabbit had said he didn’t like red.
              “I see,” the forester nodded. “You’re swelling because you’re holding onto hurt feelings. When we get upset at someone, we harm ourselves more than them. That boy’s words were unkind, but they didn’t matter to him — he just walked away. You, however, kept thinking about them, and it made you puff up. Then, when the rabbit said he preferred other colors, you poured all your hurt onto him.”
              “But he said red wasn’t his favorite color — just like the boy!” protested the balloon.
              “I didn’t mean I don’t like you,” the rabbit explained. “I love balloons! You’re beautiful.”
              “See?” said the forester. “Holding onto a grudge only hurts you. And you can’t please everyone. Not everyone will like red, or balloons, or even rabbits. And that’s okay.”
              “Really? It’s that simple?” asked the balloon.
              “Not quite. Some people say unkind things just to get attention — because they’re hurt themselves. You did the same when you told the rabbit you didn’t like rabbits. That wasn’t true, was it?”
              “No… I didn’t mean it,” admitted the balloon.
              “Then learn this — let go of grudges, or they’ll make you burst,” said the forester kindly.
              “Thank you, Mr. Forester. And I’m sorry, Bunny. Friends?”
              “Friends,” the rabbit smiled.
              The balloon stayed the night at the forester’s cabin. In the morning, back to his normal size, he waved goodbye and floated off.
              Now he knew: swelling with anger or hurt was silly and dangerous. Soon, he was flying over towns again, and the children waved and called out to him — and the little red balloon smiled as he drifted happily on.
