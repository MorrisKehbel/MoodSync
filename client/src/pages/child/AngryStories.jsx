              Bunny and Little Mouse
            </h2>
            <p>
              One warm summer morning, Bunny and Little Mouse set off for a
              walk. The sun was shining, birds were singing, and the meadow
              smelled of fresh grass. “Let’s race across the field!” Bunny
              suggested. “No, you always win,” Mouse shook his head. “Then maybe
              pick berries?” “It’s too dark in the forest. What if we get lost?”
              Finally, Mouse decided, “Let’s just walk along the path and count
              sticks.” Bunny agreed, though it wasn’t his favorite idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon they met Magpie. “There’s a sparrow concert today! Come
              join!” “No, Bunny doesn’t like concerts. We have things to do,”
              Mouse answered for both of them. Something small and hot stirred
              in Bunny’s chest, but he stayed quiet. Later, Squirrel appeared:
              “Want to play tag?” “No, we don’t like tag. We’re busy,” Mouse
              said again without asking. The hot feeling in Bunny’s chest grew
              bigger. When Mouse announced, “Tomorrow we’ll visit my mouse
              friends,” Bunny burst out: “Then go by yourself!” He ran deep into
              the forest.
            </p>
            <p>
              There, Bunny met Surikat. “You look upset. What happened?” Bunny
              told him everything. “That hot feeling? It’s anger,” Surikat
              explained. “It tells you when something doesn’t feel right. If you
              don’t speak up, it just grows. What did you want today?” “I wanted
              to go to the concert… and play with Squirrel.” “Then next time,
              say so. Your friend can’t guess your feelings.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Bunny hurried back and found Mouse sitting alone. “I’m sorry I
              yelled. I wanted to choose too,” Bunny said. “I’m sorry for not
              asking you. I was scared you’d leave me,” Mouse admitted. They
              promised to make decisions together and share feelings right away.
              That evening, they sat side by side, enjoying Mama’s carrot stew —
              and each other’s company.

              The Little Elephant Who Learned to Play Without Fighting
            </h2>
            <p>
              In the jungle, there lived a little elephant. No one was friends
              with him, because everyone was afraid of him. He fought a lot and
              was so strong that the other young animals ran away the moment
              they saw him. This didn’t make the little elephant happy. Playing
              alone was boring, but he thought, “Everyone wants to hurt me. I
              have to protect myself. If I stop fighting, they’ll take
              everything from me.”
            </p>
            <p>
              One day, the little elephant wandered into a sunny clearing.
              There, a group of young animals were playing happily together.
              They looked at the elephant, and a little monkey said: “Oh, look,
              an elephant! He must be very strong. It would be great if he could
              help us build our tower.” “No, he won’t help,” grumbled a small
              jackal. “Look at those big fists of his. He just wants to fight.”
              And the animals scattered in all directions.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Where are you going?” the elephant called after them. “I want to
              be friends with you!” “We’re scared of you!” the animals replied.
              “You’ve got such huge fists!” The elephant looked down at his feet
              — and realized they were indeed clenched into enormous fists. He
              felt a pang of sadness. For a moment, he wanted to run away. But
              then, slowly, he opened his fists and said: “I want to play with
              you. I won’t fight.”
            </p>
            <p>
              From that day on, the little elephant never clenched his fists
              again — even when he felt scared or thought someone might hurt
              him. And as time went by, he discovered that open hands were much
              better for holding toys, helping friends, and giving warm hugs.

              The Story of Anger
            </h2>
            <p>
              Once upon a time, there lived Anger. She was an enormous emotion,
              vast and unmeasurable, of a strange color that was hard to make
              out, for she sat in darkness. Only her small, glowing red eyes
              could be seen. Anger lived in a cave. She had been there for so
              long and grown so big that she could no longer leave. Her sides
              had fused with the cave walls, forming a solid, unbreakable stone
              armor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes, on dull days, Anger would stick one foot out of the
              cave’s entrance and wiggle her toes. That made her feel a little
              better — and a little freer — because fresh air could slip into
              the cave. Occasionally, landslides would happen, and small stones
              would fall on Anger’s head. She would grumble in irritation,
              trying to move, which only made more rocks tumble down, fueling
              her fury. And yet, she noticed that after these moments, the cave
              felt a little roomier.
            </p>
            <p>
              One day, she realized her sides had grown smoother from all that
              scratching. An idea came to her! Why not try to get out? Anger
              began working hard, scraping her sides against the cave walls.
              Stones rained down on her, which infuriated and annoyed her — but
              that only made her work even harder.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, she noticed there was more air and more light. That
              meant her efforts were working. A while later, she could even turn
              around inside the cave. Finally, one day, she touched herself with
              her hands and felt smoothness she didn’t remember ever having.
              Perhaps it was time to try leaving.
            </p>
            <p>
              Timidly, Anger crawled toward the cave’s entrance. The light
              outside was so bright that she squeezed her eyes shut and breathed
              deeply. Before her stood many different beings — emotions of all
              colors, sizes, and shapes. “Look! Anger has finally come out!”
              someone shouted. “We’ve been waiting for you,” said Irritation.
              “Come on! Stomp your foot like you used to,” Confidence encouraged
              her. Anger jumped onto the ground with both feet, and the earth
              boomed beneath her. “Hurrrraaay!” the emotions cheered. “We’ve
              missed you so much,” said Love, reaching out her hand.

              The Little Ball of Patience
            </h2>
            <p>
              In one town lived a family where strange things started to happen:
              everyone was restless and very, very sad. This all happened
              because their youngest child, a boy named Vanya, kept saying rude
              words and calling names—at his parents, grandparents, sisters,
              friends, and even their dog. Mom and dad often talked to him,
              telling him how hurtful these words were and asking him to stop.
              But sadly, Vanya didn’t listen.
            </p>
            <p>
              One night, when Vanya was asleep, he had a very strange dream:
              Vanya was playing with his toys when suddenly a strange ball of
              yarn rolled up to him. “Well, Vanya, I’m your patience,” the ball
              said quietly. “Every time you said hurtful words or got angry at
              someone, I got more and more tangled in knots.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The ball taught him tricks to control anger: hit a pillow, jump,
              count to ten, breathe deeply, or draw his feelings. Each time
              Vanya avoided a rude word, the ball untangled a little. Soon it
              became a long, strong thread — and the family was happy again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vanya was proud of himself for untangling his patience — and he
              wasn’t afraid of getting tangled again, because now he knew how to
              handle his anger.
